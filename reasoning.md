# Project Reasoning & Architectural Decisions

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Immersive & Fluid"
The primary goal was to build an application graph visualization tool that feels less like a static dashboard and more like an immersive interactive environment. This drove the decision to use a **"Midnight Galaxy"** aesthetic—utilizing true blacks and deep violets to create depth, allowing the colorful graph nodes to pop.

## 2. Technology Stack
*   **Vite & React**: Chosen for speed and component modularity.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Enabled rapid styling iterations and consistent design tokens.
*   **shadcn/ui**: Provided a robust foundation for accessible components (Dialogs, Buttons, Inputs), which were then heavily customized to fit the unique "glassmorphic" theme.
*   **React Flow (@xyflow/react)**: The standard for graph visualization in React. We extended it with `dagre` for deterministic auto-layouting to ensure graphs always look organized without manual user intervention.
*   **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: Implemented to simulate realistic API latency and data structures, allowing frontend development to proceed independently of backend readiness.

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### 3.1. True Black Aesthetic
We moved away from standard dark greys (`#1e293b`) to a **True Black (`#000000`)** theme. This decision was made to:
*   Create an "OLED-friendly" premium look.
*   Maximize contrast for complex graph connections.
*   Reduce visual noise, making the UI controls (which use transparency) feel like they are floating in a void.

### 3.2. Mobile-First Responsiveness
A major challenge was adapting a complex graph tool for mobile.
*   **Left Rail Transform**: The navigation rail mimics a desktop sidebar but transforms into a **Bottom Dock** on mobile devices. This keeps interactions thumb-friendly and familiar to mobile users.
*   **Floating Panels**: The `FloatingAppPanel` and `TopRightControls` use absolute positioning with collision-aware margins. On mobile, elements shift to avoid covering the graph's focal point.

### 3.3. Custom Components vs. Library Defaults
*   **Zoom Controls**: We replaced the default React Flow controls with a custom `CustomControls` widget. This allowed us to apply our specific glassmorphism styles and reposition them dynamically (Top-Right on Mobile, Bottom-Right on Desktop) to prevent layout collisions.
*   **Application Panel**: The app switcher was custom-built to match a specific "Supertokens" design reference. It handles scrollable lists of 15+ apps while maintaining a clean, scrollbar-free visual (`scrollbar-width: none`), prioritizing elegance over standard browser behaviors.

## 4. State Management
*   **Zustand**: Used for global UI state (selected app, theme preference). It was chosen over Redux for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate, fitting the agile development pace.
*   **React Query**: Handles server state (fetching apps/graphs) with built-in caching and loading states, ensuring the UI feels snappy even with simulated network delays.

## 5. Future Scalability
The codebase allows for easy extension:
*   **New Node Types**: The `ServiceNode` is registered dynamically; new node types can be added to `GraphCanvas` without rewriting the core logic.
*   **Theming**: Tailwind's `index.css` variables allow for instant rebranding (e.g., switching primary color from Violet to Blue) by changing just a few CSS variables.
